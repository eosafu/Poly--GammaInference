# Modeling the spatial patterns of antenatal care utilization in Nigeria with inference based on Pólya-Gamma mixtures
This article developed a Zero-inflated negative Binomial model within a Bayesian modeling framework. The paper adopted a Polyá-Gamma latent variable to ensure that the posterior conditional distributions of latent parameters are in close form for easier estimation. The model was applied to antenatal care utilization in Nigeria. The codes used in the simulation study can be found in this repository and the published article can be found on the following link:
